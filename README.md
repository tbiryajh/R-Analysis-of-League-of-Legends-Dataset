# R-Analysis-of-League-of-Legends-Dataset
Utilized R and R Studio to perform an analysis of a dataset collected from ranked matches of the video game League of Legends. From Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/league-of-legends. This analysis was submitted as a course project for Syracuse University's IST687 Applied Data Science. Only code that was authored by me was included.
